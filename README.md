# Open Security Policies & Standards
Open source security policies and standards templates with GitOps workflows for facilitating document lifecycle management (e.g. reviews and approvals) and exporting approved versions as PDF or other formats. 

Template options will align with various industry standard security frameworks to make it easier to structure security governance programs around them, such as NIST CSF 2.0.
